## Description
More and more people pay attention to air quality nowadays. And there are so
many Apps for us to look up the current air quality. But all you can do is just
click, click, and wait for the result which is not fun at all. So we want to
design a new way to interact.It connects your breath to the current air quality
, you just need to blow to the Phone(or Pad) and get the information you want.
